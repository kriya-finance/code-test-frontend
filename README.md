# A Game of APIs
We have a simple open API here [https://www.anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses] that returns data about the Houses in GRR Martin's *A Song of Fire and Ice*. 

## The Exercise
We would like you you to use HTML, CSS and ReactJS to consume the API and display the information in an organised fashion. 

There is no time limit for the task but we expect you to take around 30 to 60 minutes on it. Please do not take more time than necessary. 

## What we pay attention to when we evaluate your submission
* Code equality and consistency
* Naming conventions
* Styling
* Test quality
* Commit history
